# ➕➖✖️➗ Scalable Calculator Deployment with AWS ALB & Auto Scaling

Scalable Django calculator web application deployed on AWS using Application Load Balancer (ALB) and Auto Scaling Group (ASG), demonstrating load balancing, high availability, and fault-tolerant cloud deployment architecture.
This architecture helps distribute incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances while automatically replacing unhealthy instances, ensuring improved reliability and scalability for real-world application hosting.
